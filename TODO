Write the main class and functions -- public interfaces // in database.hh

Serialization and inter-process communications!

bug: if the DatabaseContext is destroyed, the main-loop thread will be crashed!
    how to solve: try to stop the main-loop in the destructor
    in main loop:
      lock the mutex
      while(this->isrunning) {...}
      free the mutex
    in destructor:
      this->isrunning = false
      try to aquire the mutex   // which means the main-loop stops
      ...
    // we should start main-loop in the constructor!
